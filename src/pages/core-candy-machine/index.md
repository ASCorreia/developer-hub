The leading minting and distribution program for fair NFT launches on Solana.

Metaplex Candy Machine is a tool that allows creators to sell or distribute large-scale NFT collections by simplifying complex processes and adding customizable rules such as time gates, supply limits, and anti-bot protections to ensure fair access for every buyer. {% .lead %}


As the name suggests, its mechanism works like a `candy machine`: creators load it with `candies` (NFTs), and buyers obtain them, without possibility of choosing, by paying SOL or SPL tokens.

**Note**: This is the [Metaplex Core](/core) version of Candy Machine, if you want to mint Metaplex Token Metadata NFTs [please refer to Candy Machine V3 instead](https://developers.metaplex.com/candy-machine/)
